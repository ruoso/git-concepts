Stage-commit workflow
x text on chart too small

Non-linear history
x parallelograms too small

Push-pull workflow
- show origin repo with its master ref

Repository architecture
x change color of tag object
x lighten the commit's red
x foobar -> newfeature
x releasex -> v1.0
x make blobs bigger (the files are bigger)

Consider adding these (in Bonus section?)
- list non-manpage help topics (revisions, ...)
- show gitk and git gui
- define fast-forward
- more on tracking branches
  - refspec
- orphaned commits and garbage collection
- how git pack works
- why git merge is better
